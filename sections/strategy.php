        <p class="invest_p">Our investment strategy seeks to capitalize on markets where we anticipate outsized growth
          and associated risk-adjusted returns. Based on demographic trends we have a deep conviction in the ongoing
          strength of multifamily, particularly in the Mountain West and in emerging Tier 2, business friendly markets.
          and are prepared to seize the moment where we find it, regardless of asset class or geography. Mixed-use
          projects requiring ground up development or significant upgrades, particularly those with a hospitality or
          residential component, or both, are always in our sights.</p>
